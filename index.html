            <h2>1. What is my favorite movie?</h2>
            
            <p><b>My favorite movie is...</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro"target="_blank">Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro!</a> 
                <br><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzYyNjg3OTctNzA2ZS00NjkzLWE4MmYtZDAzZWQ0NzkyMTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_.jpg" height="300">
                <br>It is about how Arsene Lupin III discovers that the spoils from his latest casino robbery are actually "Gothic Bills," legendary counterfeits that are nigh impossible to distinguish from genuine bills. Together with colleague Daisuke Jigen, he heads to the small nation of Cagliostro to investigate the origin of these counterfeits. Upon arrival, they save a girl from a high-speed chase who turns out to be Clarisse d' Cagliostro, the daughter of the late Duke d' Cagliostro. She is running from a sinister plot by Count Cagliostro to steal her family's treasure through a forced marriage.

                Natural flirt Lupin dislikes seeing a girl in distress and seeks to remedy the situation. Goemon Ishikawa XIII, Fujiko Mine, and Kouichi Zenigata also join the fray, each with their own motivations. As everyone converges at Cagliostro Castle, Lupin reminisces about his visit there 10 years ago, and the castle's secrets emerge from the depths...

            <h2>2. Why do <i>I</i> love this film? </h2>
            <p><b>Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro</b> is one of my favorite animated films as it is produced by TMS, the previous studio of Studio Ghibli and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki"target="_blank">Hayao Miyazaki.</a> Many of its action scenes are animated in such high fidelity such as animators who went on to make <i>Spirited Away</i> and <i>My Neighbor Tororo.</i> The mood set by the Lupin III franchise is both filled with excitement and suspense as the main cast burst through saving the girl with humorous and cool personalities. When they're struck with a serious situation, no one really knows what is to come next and that is something that I love from the series and this movie nails it. Even one of my favorite quotes comes from this movie.</i></p>
            <blockquote>
                "A demon hidden my reward in this tower. I'm not interested in your money or jewels, princess. The only reward I want is right here in front of me! I pledge to be your hero, your knight in shining armor! This is the kind of adventure I have been wishing for all my life! I want no reward, would any true knight accept a reward for saving the princess? No! The opportunity of serving you is rewarding enough."
                <br>-Lupin III, romantically showing his confidence to Princess Cagliostro.
            </blockquote>
            <h2>3. Why should <i>you</i> watch this film?</h3>
                <p>Either if you're a fan of well animated films, Studio Ghibli films, or having to be introduced to the Japanese cartoon medium, I think this is a great entry. It is a perfect film to watch with a family or with friends. It is easily accessable through Netflix or RetroCrush. The story itself can be enjoyed by children to adults that enjoy tales similar to the likes of Robin Hood. Someone you can cheer for even though they're a thief! Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro can easily be placed on your watch list that may evolve into a Lupin III franchise list. This movie got me into the series and if you're craving for more, there's about 200+ episodes waiting and many other films of Lupin III.</p>
