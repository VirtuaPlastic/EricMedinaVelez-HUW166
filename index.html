            <p style="text-align:left">Here is some recommendations of Photoshop after using it 7 years. Photoshop is an incredible tool for graphic design, but there is certainly a lot to learn for new designers, and there's always more to master for those who are already experienced. If you're currently working as a designer and looking to improve your skills, you probably find that time is a major constraint to improving your abilities.

                If so, you'll need to develop a plan to improve your skills step-by-step in the time that you have available. If you're an aspiring designer, you may have no idea where to start in order to achieve the level of success of some of the Photoshop masters that we see online.</p>

            <h2><a href="resources.html">1. Resources</a></h2>
                <p>In the resources page, I will be linking certain tutorials that can assist you throughout your learning journey. My recommendations in here will be noteable searches that you can find on Youtube, Twitter, and many other social medias.</p>

                <h2><a href="tools.html">2. Tools</a></h2>
                <p>In the resources page, I will be linking certain tutorials that can assist you throughout your learning journey. These are some tools that I could've missed out entirely and I strongly recommend to start here AFTER looking the Resource pages. The toolbar is where Photoshop holds the many tools we have to work with. There are tools for making selections, for cropping and retouching images, for adding shapes and type, and many more.</p>

                <h2><a href="cowboy.html">3. The Cowboy Trick</a></h2><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sGrayMC.gif" alt="Criminal" height=300px class="imgLeft">
                <p>There's a thing I call "The Cowboy Trick" in Photoshop. What that is the X tool and how to properly use it. In this tutorial, you will learn on how to use it correctly to crop out models, objects and other such materials to place onto other images. This goes perfectly with the the vanishing point tutorial.</p>
                
                <p>The Lasso tool is helpful for drawing a free-form border around a selected object within an image. It allows you to soften the edges of your selection or add a feathering effect; it’s also useful for anti-aliasing. You can remove the selection you make with the tool, which comes in handy when you’re trying to remove a specific person or object from an image.

                    The Lasso tool is the original freehand selection tool in Photoshop. Whereas the Marquee tool is ideal for selecting circles and rectangles, and the Magic Wand tool is perfect for selecting color ranges, the Lasso tool is your go-to function when you need to outline irregular shapes. If your desired selection consists mostly of straight lines (for instance, a parallelogram), you can use the Polygonal Lasso to create a path across each line. If you have a difficult shape with a lot of curves, you can use the Magnetic Lasso to automatically cling to the outline of your intended selection.</p>
                    <p>This is one of the most used tools in Photoshop and it goes for any kinds of professional. If you don't own Photoshop, you can still check this out as it is works in other programs such as Clip Studio Paint PRO/EX or GIMP.</p>
                    <p>More simple programs should not follow this part.</p>

                <h2><a href="vanish.html">4. Vanishing Point</a></h2><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fukb7oN.gif" alt="Criminal" height=300px class="imgRight">
                <p>A vanishing point is a point on the image plane of a perspective drawing where the two-dimensional perspective projections (or drawings) of mutually parallel lines in three-dimensional space appear to converge. When the set of parallel lines is perpendicular to a picture plane, the construction is known as one-point perspective, and their vanishing point corresponds to the oculus, or "eye point", from which the image should be viewed for correct perspective geometry. Traditional linear drawings use objects with one to three sets of parallels, defining one to three vanishing points. </p>
                <p>Vanishing Point simplifies perspective-correct editing in images that contain perspective planes—for example, the sides of a building, walls, floors, or any rectangular object. In Vanishing Point, you specify the planes in an image, and then apply edits such as painting, cloning, copying or pasting, and transforming. All your edits honor the perspective of the plane you’re working in. When you retouch, add, or remove content in an image, the results are more realistic because the edits are properly oriented and scaled to the perspective planes.</p>
                <p>With the Vanishing Point filter, you can easily add additional elements to any type of artwork that is composed of flat planes. With this filter, you first define the planes in an image, and then apply edits by painting, cloning, copying, pasting, and transforming your image. The planes you define control the perspective of the edits you make, giving your image a realistic perspective effect.</p>
                <p>Photoshop is recommended for this part. GIMP and other common programs can follow this part.</p>
            
                
                <h2><a href="process.html">5. Post Processing</a></h2><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DTD2u4p.gif" alt="Criminal" class="imgLeft">
                <p>The term post-processing is used in the video/film business for quality-improvement image processing methods used in video playback devices, and video players software and transcoding software. It is also commonly used in real-time 3D rendering to add additional effects. Video post-processing is the process of changing the perceived quality of a video on playback (done after the decoding process). Image scaling routines such as linear interpolation, bilinear interpolation, or cubic interpolation can for example be performed when increasing the size of images; this involves either subsampling (reducing or shrinking an image) or zooming (enlarging an image). This helps reduce or hide image artifacts and flaws in the original film material. It is important to understand that post-processing always involves a trade-off between speed, smoothness and sharpness. </p>
                <p>In this image, I use many layers on top of the image such as specks of dirt, replicating film grain, scratches, color grading, and a VHS effect. This can be achieved through many ways but in this tutorial, I will show the easiest way to do so.</p>
                <p>Photoshop is recommended for this part. Clip Studio Paint PRO/EX, GIMP, and other common programs can follow this part. More simple programs cannot follow this part.</p>
